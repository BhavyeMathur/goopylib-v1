Description: # Goopy
        
        ## Introduction
        Goopy is a simple-yet-powerful 2D graphics framework built on top of Tkinter capable of creating good-looking, modern GUIs, games, and animations.
        
        This graphics library is built upon John Zelle's graphics.py package which he made for use with his textbook "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science". Over the past 2 years, I have worked on editing this library to add more featurs to use with making my GUIs and games. My entire aim while editing was to create a powerful medium to enable me to create good-looking graphics within Python and I have spent a lot of time making sure this is the case. Thus, this is a very intuitive, simple to use package with the potential of growing into one of the best Python Graphics Libraries. 
        
        If you would want to contribute to this library by suggesting features, reporting bugs, or adding changes yourself, please do so. I would love it if you would use this library in your projects and do make sure to tell me about them! Right now, this is very much an alpha stage - there are many bugs, many features that aren't compatible with each other, and a ton of things to do differently, but this will all be fixed with future releases. 
        
        Goopy is also compatible with [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) also known as Pyinstaller. This compatibility mainly means that all paths to textures & sounds are automatically converted into the absolute paths which you don't have to worry about! This means that you will be able to convert applications written with Goopy into executables, hopefully, with 0 errors.  
        
        If you want to contact me, you can drop me an email at: bhavyemathur@gmail.com or post an issue on the issues tab.
        
        ### Installation
        
        The Primary method to install this library is from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/goopylib/1.0.7a6/) via pip:
        
        ```terminal
        pip install goopylib
        ```
         or 
         
         ```terminal
         pip3 install goopylib
         ```
         
         This will install Goopy and all the requirements for it to run. You can then import the library as shown next.
        
        An alternative method to use this library is very simple to use especially if you want access to the source code, all 
        you need is the folder called 'goopylib' and the requirements. This just includes the 
        [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (PIL) module which you can download individually. 
        
        Download the folder and place it wherever you want access to the library. 
        
        Then, simply import as so:
        
        ```python
        
        from goopylib.imports import *
        # or
        import goopylib as gp
        
        ```
        
        The first allows you to import everything that is part of the library, but if you want only specific classes & functions, read on. 
        
        ### Organization
        
        Goopy is organized into a few different files and depending on what you want to do, you can import these files. There are 2 subfolders in goopy: math & objects. The objects folder contains all of the graphics objects you might want to use like Images, Rectangles, Buttons, etc. To import these, type:
        
        ```python
        from goopylib.math.BezierCurve import BezierCurve # The other modules are 'Interpolation', & 'BSpline'
        # or
        from goopylib.objects.Rectangle import Rectangle  # For a list of graphics objects, look at the documentation
        ```
        
        To access elements of Goopy like the Point & GraphWin classes, Colours, etc. use this:
        
        ```python
        from goopylib.colours import *
        
        from goopylib.GraphWin import GraphWin
        from goopylib.Point import Point
        ```
        
        ### Documentation
        
        There are plans to create a detailed documentation for this library both in the form of YouTube videos and a written document and the creation of the documentation has begun at: https://github.com/BhavyeMathur/goopylib/wiki
        
        ### Projects made using Goopy
        
        As these are entire projects with a lot of code and non-goopy elements, I have not supplied the code. But, if you want to look at example projects with code, skip to the next section 'Examples'. 
        
        **1. A Pac-Man Recreation**
        
        I worked on this as a school project and used the goopy library to create fully functional Pac-Man Game! (and an arcade too!) Pac-Man runs around while the ghosts (all animated of course) chase after him! He must collect all the pellets and fruits to go on to the next level.
        
        ![Pac-Man Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BhavyeMathur/goopylib/master/Examples/Pac-Man.png)
        
        **2. Multiplayer UNO**
        
        During the COVID-19 Pandemic, my friends and I often hopped on a call and played a few games together: one such, was UNO. But the app we used was very laggy and didn't really function well. So I took it upon myself to create a Multiplayer UNO game in 5 days or less - and I succeeded on day 6... *"but day indices start at 0 so it was really the fifth day..."*. 
        
        The game allows 2-7 players to play together and the graphics animate the cards, rotate them randomly, make them travel to the centre (as opposed to just instantly moving there) and more.
        
        Here is a screenshot of the game:
        
        ![UNO Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BhavyeMathur/goopylib/master/Examples/MultiplayerUNO.png)
        
        Avatar graphics are from freepik.com
        
        **3. Activity Club Selection App**
        
        My school has these weekly activity clubs where we all go to well, do activities. And every year, we sign up for activities using a pen & paper. Writing down our choices, handing them over to our teachers and waiting for them to sort through hundreds of entries and assign everybody a club - but not this year. This year I made an activity club selection app using the goopy library that would automatically do all this work for you! 
        
        Goopy is compatible with auto-py-to-exe which means you can easily convert any program into a .exe file and mail it to anyone to use. Now mind you, this was made with an older version of Goopy so it did not contain lots of animations and visual feedback, but here is a screenshot:
        
        ![Activity Selection App Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BhavyeMathur/goopylib/master/Examples/ActivtySelectionApp.png)
        
        ### Examples
        
        These examples with the code and required textures are included in folders for you to download and try out for yourselves!
        
        1. This is a simply, modern, light Login Page that can be used for your application. It demonstrates the usage of Checkbox, Entries, and Buttons to take input from the user and was made entirely with just 60 lines of code! (excluding comments). 
        
        This includes giving the user visual feedback if they hover over a button, making sure the user has entered a valid input, a functional tab to change from registering to signing up, and more.
        
        ![GUI Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BhavyeMathur/goopylib/master/Examples/ModernUI-LoginPage%20Example/ExampleScreenshot.png)
        
        2. Also provided is a very simple animation of Pac-Man being chased by some ghosts and it was created with just 40 lines of code! This really is an example of how simple animations such as these can help make a really good game or project. 
        
        Goopy also has functionality for other animations such as moving to locations, rotating animations, and a lot to come soon. I am planning to include animations for almost every attribute of a Graphics Object like size, colour, outline thickness, transformation (skewing, fliping, etc.) and more. It also contains easy-to-use easing functions like those you would find in a professional animator.

        * Added flipping functions to the Image class: `flip()`, `flip_xy()`, `flip_x()`, `flip_y()`, `transpose()`, & `transverse()`
        
        * Added `get_mode()` and `get_format()` methods to the Image class
        * Fixed the image get size functions to return the size of the PIL image rather than itself (useful for transformations & stuff)
        * Added skewing function to the Image class: `skew()`, `skew_x()`, `skew_y()`, and `scew_xy()` (This was so confusing to implement...)
        * Added `set_contrast()`, `change_contrast()`, `reset_contrast()`, and `get_contrast()` functions to the Image object
        * The Image now keeps its contrast settings while rotating after the contrast has been changed

        * Added `get_mouse_pos()` and `check_keys_down` functions to the GraphWin
        * The user can now specify if they want duplicate animations and they can give a duplicates metric to specify what a duplicate is
        * Renamed all the arguments for animations such as `Rotation`, `Distance`, `Colour Change`, etc. to just `Change`
        * Added a `check_animation_exists()` function to the GraphWin to check if an animation already exists
